## Chrome Bookmarks
Searches through your current Chrome bookmarks. This does not cache them in a
database, but reads directly from the JSON bookmarks file. This makes it
drastically faster.

This will search trough the name of your bookmark and the URL. It split your
query into grams for inclusive matching and a ranking system to show relevant
results first.
